## Department History

The Department of Anatomy had its beginnings in Toland Medical College, which was founded in 1864, and became the Medical Department of the University of California in 1873.  Insofar as can be determined from the records available in its history of over one hundred years, there have been the following chairmen:

- 1864 - 1866	Dr. J. Newton Brown
- 1866 - 1870	Dr. Levi Cooper Lane
- 1870 – 1874	Dr. Vansant
- 1874 – 1878	Dr. Alexander A. O’Neil (also Dean)
- 1878 – 1879	Dr. Robert A. McLean (later Dean)
- 1879 – 1884	During this period Dr. William Lewitt was Lecturer in Anatomy, assisted by his son, Dr. William B. Lewitt
- 1884 – 1891	Dr. William B. Lewitt
- 1891 – 1901	Dr. John M. Williamson
- 1901 – 1907	Dr. Joseph Marshall Flint
- 1915 – 1934	Dr. Herbert M. Evans
- 1934 – 1937	Dr. Ian Maclaren Thompson
- 1938 – 1956	Dr. J.B. deC. M. Saunders (also Medical Librarian and later Dean, Provost, and Chancellor)
- 1956 – 1963	Dr. William O. Reinhardt (later Dean)
- 1963 – 1970	Dr. Ian W. Monie
- 1967 – 1968	Dr. C. Willet Asling
- 1970 – 1973	Dr. Jacob de Groot
- 1973 – 1997	Dr. Henry J. Ralston III
- 1997 - 	Dr. Allan Basbaum

At the turn of the century, Dr. J. Marshall Flint, with the assistance of Drs. R. O. Moody and Irving Hardesty, undertook extensive reorganization of the teaching program and established courses in histology, microscopic organology, neurology, regional anatomy, and organogenesis. As well as special courses for physicians and advanced students; opportunities were also provided for capable students to undertake research.

The earthquake of 1906 damaged the Medical School buildings to such an extent that the Basic Science departments were transferred temporarily to the Berkeley campus; in the case of the Department of Anatomy, this period of exile lasted 52 years.

Today the department performs research and teaching from the Parnassus and Mission Bay campuses.

Congratulations to our Chair Allan Basbaum on being the co-recipient, along with Cliff Woolf and Claire Hulsebosch, of the "Reeve-Irvine Research Medal" for 2016.  This medal is given by the Reeve-Irvine Research Center at the University of California Irvine to researchers who have made recent critical contributions to promoting repair of the damaged spinal cord, recovery of function and/or improvement of quality of life for people living with spinal cord injury. The Medal is to recognize “...the most meritorious science, a proven body of work that has withstood the test of time and scrutiny, as well as other enriching contributions to the field”.  This year’s medal recognizes your fundamental discoveries related to pain, which is of course one of the major negative impacts on quality of life for many people living with spinal cord injury.

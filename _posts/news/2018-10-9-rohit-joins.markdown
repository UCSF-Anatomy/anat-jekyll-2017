After an honors thesis studying lymphocyte costimulation with Professor Peter Bretscher, he joined Professor Jeff Wrana's lab during his MD/PhD at the University of Toronto, researching how the TGF-beta and Wnt signaling pathways tightly regulate the epithelial architecture of cells beyond transcriptional control.  He then entered the Medical Research Track of Internal Medicine Residency at Weill Cornell, followed by Medical Oncology Fellowship at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.  As a Fellow and Instructor there, he trained in Dr. Charles Sawyers' lab, studying how oncogenic and tumor suppressive transcription factors coordinate to give rise to prostate cancer.

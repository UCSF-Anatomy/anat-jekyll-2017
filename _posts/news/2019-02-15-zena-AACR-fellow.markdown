Congradulations to our own Zena Werb for her being elected to the Fellows of the AACR Academy Class of 2019.

The mission of the AACR Academy is to recognize and honor distinguished scientists whose major scientific contributions have propelled significant innovation and progress against cancer, and to leverage the expertise of the global brain trust of [Fellows of the AACR Academy](https://www.aacr.org/Membership/Pages/Fellows.aspx) to advance the mission of the AACR to prevent and cure all cancers through research, education, communication, and collaboration.
